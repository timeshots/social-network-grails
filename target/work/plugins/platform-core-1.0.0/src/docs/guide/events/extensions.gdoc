Writing extensions is one of the greatest habbits of *grails* developpers. Groovy and Grails communites are like that,
pragmatic and pleasant.

Having seen the referenced beans in the previous chapter should already give you ideas to improve or customize your needs.
There are two available examples of extensions:
* [events-si|http://github.com/smaldini/grails-events-si] : This plugin overrides the publisher and registry beans in order to replace the default mechanisms with the much
more flexible Spring Integration channels and endpoints.
* [events-push|http://github.com/smaldini/grails-events-push] : This plugin registers new Listeners from your cool browsers using javascript, authorized through the
new Events DSL attributes _browser_ and _browserFilter_
