You can render any part of your navigation structure as a menu as many times as you like anywhere in your pages, using the [menu|navigationTags] tag.

h3. Rendering multiple navigation scopes on the same page

A typical contemporary application will have something like three separate menus used on most pages; main, user and footer.

The main menu would use [primary|navigationTags] & [secondary|navigationTags] tags.

You would then render the user and footer navigation using the menu tag, and passing the user and footer scopes:

{docx:xml}
<html>
<body>
    <nav:primary/>
    <nav:secondary/>

    <div id="user-nav">
        <nav:menu scope="user"/>
    </div>

    <g:layoutBody/>

    <div id="footer-nav">
        <nav:menu scope="footer"/>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
{docx}

This results in a page where there are actually for navigation renderings, showing different scopes.
