The primary navigation is the top level application the user sees, and the secondary is the context-sensitive sub items of the currently active primary item.

Contemporary site styles typically separate out the primary and secondary navigation.

The primary and secondary tags are geared up for this and automatically lookup up the scope and activation path to work out what to render.

Normally you will only use these once in a page.
