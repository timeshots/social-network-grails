The features include in this release include:

* Configuration API - Plugin-namespaced config, Config merging, validation and default values
* Security API - An abstraction of basic security features that most applications require, with implementations to be provided by plugins or your application
* UI Extensions - A set of tags and helper properties and functions
* Navigation API - A standard artefact and DSL for navigation and tags for accessing this
* Events API - A standard event bus that can be plugged in to any event implementation, with a lightweight default provider for in-app messaging

Each feature is covered in more detail later in this documentation.

The platform is very self-referential - it uses own APIs - for example to provide event hooks for Grails application lifecycle, to declare dynamic methods on your controller and service artefacts, and to declare the configuration values that it uses.

All of these APIs are designed to be as simple as possible.

Use this platform to add tighter and more consistent integration to your own plugins.
