To change application or plugin configuration from within a plugin you need to declare the *doWithConfig* hook in your plugin descriptor.

The code uses a simple DSL that is identical to normal Config except:

# The top level nodes are plugin names or "application" to determine what scope of config you are changing
# The closure is passed the existing config as its first and only argument

The application Config is loaded first. All the doWithConfig blocks are evaluated and the results merged in.

def doWithConfig = { config ->
    platformUi {
        ui.Bootstrap.button.cssClass = 'btn'
        ui.Bootstrap.tab.cssClass = 'tab-pane'
        ui.Bootstrap.field.cssClass = 'input'
    }

    application {
        // set something based on another config value that has already been
        // by the application
        grails.x.y = config.p.q == 'something' ? true : false
    }
}

See [doWithConfig|pluginConventions] for more details.
