h1. pluginRequestAttributes

This property is available to controllers and taglibs, to provide access to the request attributes for only the plugin that
defines the controller or taglib.

Use this instead of @request[xxxx]@ in your plugin code, to prevent keys accidentally clashing across plugins and apps:

{docx}
class MyPluginController {
    def index = {
        pluginRequestAttributes.message =
            "This is safe, even if app or other plugin uses [message]"
    }
}
{docx}

The object returned is a @PropertyNamespacer@ instance, which supports property access, keySet() and toMap() to return only the keys and data
that is provided by the plugin.
