h1. grailsEvents

The grailsEvents bean is an instance of
[Events|api:org.grails.plugin.platform.events.Events] that provides access to the
generic [events bus features|guide:events] of the platform.

The implementation itself delegates much of the functionality to
@grailsEventsPublisher@ and @grailsEventsRegistry@ beans provided by any events bus plugins that are installed.
