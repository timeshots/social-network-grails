h1. grailsSecurity

The grailsSecurity bean is an instance of
[Security|api:org.grails.plugin.platform.security.Security] that provides access to the generic security features of the platform.

The implementation itself delegates much of the functionality to a
@grailsSecurityBridge@ bean provided by any security plugins that are installed.
